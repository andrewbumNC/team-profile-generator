## Description: 
The team profile generator allows users to build their teams using a command line application. User will input both their own name and that of their team members along with information relevant to each of them including: role, email, id number. Some specicific information will be asked depending on the role of the user. For example if an engineer user is being added then it will ask for their github username. 

## Installation:
Simply download the code to a directory. Make sure you have inquierer installed and use the command line to invoke the application by typing in node filename.js

## Usage:
This is a straightforward application and should be easy to use. I did not include input validation rules so make sure your information is correct when inputting. 

## Contributing:
None

## Tests
Test files are included in the repo
